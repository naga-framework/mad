\subsection{Single-File Bundles with MAD}

The key feature of mad is ability to create single-file bundled web sites.
Thus making dream to boot simpler than node.js come true.
This target escript is ready to run on Windows, Linux and Mac.

To make this possible we implemented a zip filesytem inside escript.
mad packages priv directories along with ebin and configs.
You can redefine each file in zip fs inside target
escript by creation the copy with same path locally near escript.
After launch all files are copied to ETS.
N2O also comes with custom cowboy static handler that is able to
read static files from this cached ETS filesystem.
Also bundle are compatible with active online realoading and recompilation.
